# Countdown Timer

## Overview
This is a simple web-based countdown timer application that allows users to set a timer by specifying hours, minutes, and seconds. The timer counts down to zero and alerts the user when the time is up.

## Features
- User inputs for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Start button to begin the countdown.
- Reset button to stop the countdown and clear inputs.
- Real-time display of the remaining time in HH:MM:SS format.
- Alert notification when the countdown reaches zero.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure.
- CSS3 for styling.
- JavaScript for timer functionality.

## How to Use
1. Open the `countdown_timer.html` file in a modern web browser.
2. Enter the desired countdown time using the input fields for hours, minutes, and seconds.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the countdown.
4. The timer will display the remaining time and count down every second.
5. When the timer reaches zero, an alert will notify you that the time is up.
6. Click the "Reset" button to stop the timer and clear the inputs.

## Project Structure
- `countdown_timer.html`: The main HTML file containing the timer UI, styles, and JavaScript logic.

## Notes
- The timer input fields accept only valid numbers within specified ranges (hours: 0-99, minutes: 0-59, seconds: 0-59).
- If the total time entered is zero or invalid, the timer will not start and will prompt the user to enter a valid time.
